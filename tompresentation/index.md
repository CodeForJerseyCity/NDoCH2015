# Reproducibility

### Why Reproducibility

- <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">YOU</span> are responsible for your work
- Replication is often times impossible

- Validation of <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">your</span> methods

- Validation of <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">your</span>  data

- So discrepancies can be identified  
    ... and remedied (by <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">you</span>) or <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">your</span> vindication.

- No one is immune from errors

    A former manager of mine said "The only people who don't make mistakes are those who don't do anything"

### Challenge Results

Whether <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">you</span> do, or not, someone else looking at <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">your</span> data will.

- Challenge <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">your</span> steps

  - <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">Your</span> initial question

  - The data source

  - The processing <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">you</span> did

  - <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">Your</span> analysis

  - <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">Your</span> conclusions
